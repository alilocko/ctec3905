# Lab 2: CSS tutorial

This repository contains an HTML and a CSS file in a separate folder, with another folder for images.

To preserve the original CSS file and work on your own changes, duplicate it with a different name, change the link in the HTML `head` section, and start experimenting.

Create as many CSS files as you like for different experiments! If it all goes wrong, duplicate the original again.

We have now added 'styles2.css' so you can understand how the alternative layout shown in 'Exercise stage 2' is made.

**Remember:** `box-sizing: border-box;` means padding and border appear *inside* the width, instead of adding to it!
